           expression '2 << i'. In particular, the analyzer is not able to
           guarantee '0 â‰¤ (int)(2<<i) < 32' valid (on x86 architecture).

           Note that, as soon as the variable 'i' takes the value 4, the
           left-shift expression '2 << i' evaluates to 32. Hence, '1 << (2 <<
           i)' reduces to '1 << 32'.

           According to section 6.5.7 of the C11 Standard, the behavior of '1 <<
           32' is undefined. This is because, on x86 architecture, the right
           operand 32 is greater than or equal to the width (in bits) of the
           left operand 1.
